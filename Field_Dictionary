Dictionary for the variables in the main mapping dataset. 


e_UI - unique identifier created for the mapping, which uniquely identifies a field.

human_readable_name - will be the description related to the e_UI. Currently empty. Will assign names later.

snomed code - snomed unique identifier which we are eventually want to use to replace the e_UI

destination - terminology the field is being mapped to - can currently be ICNARC, HICDS1, ICIP. SNOMED has to be mapped. 
              have no data for it yet.

destination_id - term used for to identify the field in the destination terminology. 
  if destination = ICNARC, the code in the field is the ICNARC field label
  if destination = HICDS1, the code in the field is the CCHIC id code
  if destination = ICIP, the code in the field is the ICIP label. It was named ICNARC_ICIP_Map in the old dataset.
  if destination = SNOMED, the code in the field will be the SNOMED concept id.

destination_name - the full name of the field in the destination terminology used. 
  if destination = ICNARC, the name will be the icnarc full name
  if destination = HICDS1, the name will be the CCHIC long name
  if destination = ICIP, the field should be blank since there is currently no long name.
  if destination = SNOMED, the name will be the SNOMED fully specified name.
  
destination_hierachy - the location of the field in the hierachy of the destination terminology.
  if destination = ICNARC, it will be the name of the icnarc section
  if destination = HICDS1, it will be the HIC clinical tag.
  if destination = ICIP, the field should be blank.
  if destination = SNOMED, it will be the location of the field in the snomed hierachy.
  
  
valid - is this mapping currently valid? Takes the value 1 if mapping is valid, 0 if not.
date_modified - when was the mapping last edited? will be a date field DD/MM/YYYY
modified_by - who edited this mapping? 


  
  
  
  
  
  Variables which were in the original dataset which were deleted. Most of these were deleted because they are incorrect/empty
  snomed mappings.
